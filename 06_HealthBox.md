## What Is HealthBox?

**HealthBox** lets doctors record and track basic patient vitals like:
- Weight
- Blood Pressure
- Blood Sugar
- Temperature
- SPO2
- Pulse Rate

This feature is useful during in-clinic consultations or online calls to monitor patient health trends.

2. Select the patient profile.
3. Enter the relevant vitals.
4. Tap **Save** — the data is stored and visible to both doctor and patient.

## Use Case

During a follow-up, Dr. Meera updates a patient’s BP and sugar readings in HealthBox. This helps her track changes since the last visit.
